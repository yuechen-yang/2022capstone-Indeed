Management, overall, genuinely cared about and encouraged the success of their employees, even if that meant losing that employee to another department when they landed a promotion. There used to be plenty of opportunity to advance within the company, but I don't know if that's still the case, post pandemic.  This company has a very strong commitment to diversity and inclusion and everyone I ever worked with was respectful of one another. The workplace culture was a positive one and there was flexibility with work hours if you needed to come in late or leave early due to a doctor's appointment or family emergency.  What I learned was that no matter how long you've given your dedicated service to the company, it will cut you loose in a heartbeat if their profit margin starts to suffer.
