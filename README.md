# Background
There are many aspects that can influence the employees’ emotions during working, such as whether they have good benefits and whether they have friendly working environment. Some companies are willing to invest to their people because they think if their employees have good emotions during workday, they will work more effectively, and finally help the companies make more profits. However, whether this is true or not, we don’t know. This is why I have the motivation question for this project: Do firms who invest in their people have better financial performance than those who don’t? My initial hypothesis is yes for this motivation question. But whether my initial hypothesis is right or not, I need to do more exploration on it.
